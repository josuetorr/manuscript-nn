# Modular Basic Neural Network

## Basic idea
It's pretty simple; a neural network where it's parameters can be adjusted from outside the source code.  

We can change the following paramters:
- Number of hidden layers
- Number of neurons per layer
- Initial weights  

For now, this is all we can change. Obviously, the training data can be provided as an external file. For now, we will only support csv.
